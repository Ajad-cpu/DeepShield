# DeepShield - DeepFake Detection

DeepFake Detection Web-App ðŸ–¥ using Deep Learning (ResNext and LSTM), Flask, and ReactJs where you can predict whether a video is FAKE or REAL along with the confidence ratio.

## Explanation of the Project

* Designed a DeepFake Detection system to identify DeepFake videos using Deep Learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. Integrated the trained model with a ReactJS Frontend and Flask Backend.
* The dataset used to train the model is available [here](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics).
* Trained model files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-zErGZ9T89TplQs3ws4QVRFlqE-ljW6l?usp=sharing).
* Model training reference taken from [this resource](https://github.com/abhijitjadhav1998/Deepfake_detection_using_deep_learning/tree/master/Model%20Creation).

1. **DeepFake\_Detection** - Root folder of the project.
2. **Implementation Video** - Shows complete working of the project.
3. **Project-Setup.txt** - Contains all steps to set up and run the project.
4. **Requirements.txt** - Python libraries needed for this project.

## Project Set-up Guidelines

Setup instructions are listed [here](https://github.com/Ajad-cpu/DeepShield/blob/main/Project-Setup.txt).

## Notes

1. In the root folder (`DeepFake_Detection`), create a folder called `Uploaded_Files`.
2. In the root folder (`DeepFake_Detection`), create a folder called `model` and add the [model file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-zErGZ9T89TplQs3ws4QVRFlqE-ljW6l?usp=sharing) in it.

*(Paths are already set in `server.py`, so this avoids errors.)*
